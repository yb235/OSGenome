   cd UI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start the Python backend (in separate terminal):**
   ```bash
   python api_server.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## üé≠ Theme

The interface maintains a humorous "genetic YOLO trading" theme while providing professional functionality:
- Trading-style terminology for genetic analysis
- Financial market metaphors for genetic data
- Professional metrics presentation
- Engaging and informative user experience

## üö¶ API Endpoints

The UI integrates with the following backend endpoints:
- `POST /analyze` - Upload and analyze genetic files
- `GET /progress` - Real-time analysis progress
- `GET /results` - Download analysis results

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**UI not loading:**
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Verify the development server is running (`npm run dev`)

**API connection issues:**
- Ensure Python backend is running on port 8000
- Check CORS configuration in `api_server.py`
- Verify proxy configuration in `vite.config.js`

**Build issues:**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check for version compatibility issues
- Ensure all peer dependencies are satisfied
