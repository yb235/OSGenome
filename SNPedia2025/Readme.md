# SNPedia Complete Database Mirror
*A comprehensive collection of genetic variant information from SNPedia*

## Overview
This database contains a complete mirror of SNPedia's genetic variant entries, totaling 111,727 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and related genetic variants. SNPedia is a wiki-based bioinformatics resource that catalogs the functional consequences of human genetic variation, serving as a valuable reference for personal genomics, medical genetics, and genetic genealogy.

## Database Contents
- **Total Entries**: 111,727
  - Rs SNPs (Reference SNP cluster IDs): 108,873 (97.4%)
  - I-SNPs (23andMe internal identifiers): 2,851 (2.6%)  
  - Other variants: 3 (0.0%)
    - MYH6 c.2161 / MYH6_c.2161 (gene mutation, duplicate entries)
    - OMIM604611.0004 (OMIM database reference)
